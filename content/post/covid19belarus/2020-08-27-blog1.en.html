<p>On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a novel coronavirus and name it <em>2019-nCoV</em>. Coronavirus is a large virus family, known to cause colds and more serious diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The new type of coronavirus is a new strain of coronavirus that has never been found in the human body before. Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has continued to carry out influenza and related disease surveillance, and multiple cases of viral pneumonia have been found, all diagnosed as viral pneumonia/pulmonary infection.</p>

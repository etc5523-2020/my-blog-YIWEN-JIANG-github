&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic, also known as the COVID-19 pandemic. The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, and a pandemic in March 2020. As of 11 October 2020, more than 37.2 million cases have been confirmed as well as more than 1.07 million deaths attributed to COVID-19. This blog post is an introduction of the Coronavirus Pandemic Shiny app, and mainly focus on reviewing the app and offer the points need to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;introduction-of-the-shiny-app&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction of the Shiny App&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel restrictions, lockdowns, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures have been implemented. These have caused the social and economic disruption, including the largest global recession since the Great Depression. Extreme poverty and global famines are affecting hundreds of millions, inflamed by supply shortages. Many events, the environment and education systems have also been affected. Misinformation about the virus has circulated globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the news, it can be difficult to explain. How fast is the virus spreading? Are the efforts to control the disease effectively? How does the spread of the virus differ between the countries? Affected by the pandemic, how have people’s daily activities changed? By looking beyond the news, we hope it is possible to have a deeper understanding of this pandemic through this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this app is to complement the raw data by providing interactive visualisation which is not available by the news, including the timeline function and the ability to compare between countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app contains four tabs (as showing in Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:tabs-in-shiny&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;): Data, About, Change in Visitors by Category and COVID-19 Cases/Deaths. Following are the discussion of the contents of these four tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:tabs-in-shiny&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;tabs.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tabs in the shiny dashboard&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Tabs in the shiny dashboard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;: To display the raw data used in this app, users can select the variables and observations they want to view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About&lt;/strong&gt;: Relevant information about this app, such background of the COVID-19, code used to create this app, creator and references.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change in Visitors by Category&lt;/strong&gt;: Show the change in the frequency of people going to the places compared to before the pandemic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 Cases/Deaths&lt;/strong&gt;: Use plots and tables to show the difference in the number of cases and deaths between countries, as well as the trend of those number changes over the past few months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;self-review&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Self Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;points-did-well&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points did well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, this app uses the shiny dashboard to place different content under the corresponding tabs, so that users can clearly understand the structure of the app, and more directly guide users to find the content they want to view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:data-tab&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;data_tab.png&#34; alt=&#34;Data tab in the dashboard&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 2: Data tab in the dashboard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt; tab (Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:data-tab&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) in the dashboard provides an overview of raw data used in this app. And the data source and source of the code are provided under the &lt;strong&gt;About&lt;/strong&gt; (Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:about-tab&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)if the users want to reproduce the shiny app, it can provide the users with a preliminary understanding of the data and easier to obtain the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:about-tab&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;about_tab.png&#34; alt=&#34;About tab in the dashboard&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 3: About tab in the dashboard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plots and tables in the app will be changed based on the input selected by the users, and the plots and tables under each tab are related. So that the users can make corresponding adjustments according to the information they are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corresponding notes are included in the tabs, telling users how to select input, and what the output results of pictures and tables mean. Expanded explanations for some input selections. For example, users may not be able to accurately understand what Retail &amp;amp; Recreation represents, for this reason, some of the examples of this place are provided in the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app also provides more innovative content: “Change in Visitors by Category”. Since most of the visualization since the pandemic is based on the number of cases and deaths. This content provides a new perspective which is what changes have been made in people’s lives after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;points-need-to-improve&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Points need to improve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are too many input choices under each tab, causing users may be confused by how to select the input and get the result as they expected. The inputs selection for a certain plot or table can be combined in a single box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:covid19-tab&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;covid19_tab.png&#34; alt=&#34;COVID-19 Cases/Deaths tab in the dashboard&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 4: COVID-19 Cases/Deaths tab in the dashboard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table under the COVID-19 Cases/Deaths tab (Refer to Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:covid19-tab&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;) will become longer as more countries been selected, cause the arrangement under this tab looking not tidy. And the “Select Countries” option will change the two plots at the same time. It is not very reasonable to put the selection above the right plot. Also, it would be better if the title of the plot on the left can be modified when users changed their selections, that will make the tittle more relevant with the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34; style=&#34;text-align: center&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:visitor-tab&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;visitor_tab.png&#34; alt=&#34;Change in Visitors by Category tab in the dashboard&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 5: Change in Visitors by Category tab in the dashboard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the map under the Change in Visitors by Category tab (Refer to Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:visitor-tab&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;) is not large enough, and it is not possible to observe some countries or territories with a small area, such as countries in the European. It is a better choice to put the map under a new tab, or use &lt;code&gt;ggplotly&lt;/code&gt; allows users to zoom in on specific locations according to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;things-plausible-to-add-in-the-app&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things plausible to add in the app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we are tired to watching the changes in the number of cases and deaths in the form of a map, it is still an effective way to visualise, and users can more intuitively to compare the difference on the numbers between the adjacent countries. In addition, the data are a time series, by using animation to display the changing on the numbers over time will be more efficient to observe the changing or trending at a certain period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;limitation-of-the-data-and-technology&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitation of the data and technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the visitors’ raw data are provided by Google and Apple, there are many limitations and resections during the data collection. For example, Google map is not available in China and Chinese people mainly uses Baidu maps. This has caused the values in some of the countries are missing. The users will only be available to compare the countries which have available data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating this app, the original idea was to give the COVID-19 data of the corresponding country based on the click on the map. However, the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the same country are different when each time click on the map. For example, although Melbourne and Sydney are both in Australia, their geographic locations are different. A country can have countless coordinates, and the shape of each country is different. It is limited by the technology to accurately filter out the relevant information of that country based on the click on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a person returned to Toronto from Wuhan, Hubei, China, tested positive, it was confirmed that the virus had reached Canada on January 27, 2020. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5, and Toronto’s chief health officer announced on March 16 that there is “some evidence of community transmission”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-March, as cases of community transmission were confirmed, all of Canada’s provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Provinces and territories have, to varying degrees, implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on gatherings, closures of non-essential businesses, restrictions on entry, and mandatory self-isolation for travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada’s COVID-19 data was collected by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada&#34;&gt;COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group&lt;/a&gt;; the dataset includes the number of confirmed cases, deaths and testing data. It is also separate the data into a different province. The datasets are stored in separate &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; files. By exploring these datasets, we will discover some stories that are related to the datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-there-is-a-vast-number-of-confirmed-cases-in-canada&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why there is a vast number of confirmed cases in Canada?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada and Australia have always been used to compare between each other because the two countries have much in common: beautiful scenery, vast space, sparse population, metropolitan cities with large numbers of international tourists, and well-funded health systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;table&#34; style=&#34;font-size: 24px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34;&gt;
&lt;caption style=&#34;font-size: initial !important;&#34;&gt;

&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
136,825
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
118,990
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
9,205
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
8,630
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2020, Canada and Australia had similar COVID-19 experiences, but they started to differ from each other in dramatic ways at the end of March. As of September 10, 2020, there have been approximately 136,825 confirmed cases, over 118,990 recoveries, over 9,205 deaths and 8,630 cases in Canada (Refer to Table &lt;a href=&#34;#tab:summ-table&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Compared to Australia, the data is even more impressive. As of September 10, there are total 26,692 cumulated confirmed cases in Australia. The cumulative number of confirmed cases fewer than Canada over one million!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both countries have implemented distancing measures, the effect is not satisfactory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-March, Canadians held a large wedding in Montreal, and Australians enjoyed the sun at Bondi Beach in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen restrictions and strengthen law enforcement. The two countries are also testing COVID-19 at a similar rate. But by the end of March, the number of new daily cases in Australia start to decline, while the number of cases in Canada increased sharply. Why have the paths of these two countries with seemingly similar approaches to the pandemic diverged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:canada-map&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-1&#34; style=&#34;width:720px;height:480px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/json&#34; data-for=&#34;htmlwidget-1&#34;&gt;{&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;/post/covid19canada/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_canada-map.html&#34;,&#34;options&#34;:{&#34;xdomain&#34;:&#34;*&#34;,&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;lazyload&#34;:false}},&#34;evals&#34;:[],&#34;jsHooks&#34;:[]}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Compared with the northern region of Canada, the number of cases in the southern provinces seems to be higher, especially in Ontario and Quebec.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the early cases in Australia were imported from overseas travelers and passed on to their direct contacts. It is relatively easy for people arriving by plane or ship to pass through strict contact tracing, which is even more difficult when travelers drive across long-distance borders (such as the border separating Canada and the United States). From the map (Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:canada-map&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;), we can see the cases are in provinces or territories in northern of Canada are much less than the southern, which is the border with the United States. Especially in Ontario and Quebec, the total number was exceeding 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because, Although Canada and the United States have reached an agreement since the beginning of the pandemic to close their borders for “non-essential” travel on March 21, 2020. There are still many Americans who have been taking advantage of the so-called “Alaska loophole” Enter Canada. It has been reported that those who discovered the loophole, tell the authorities that they were only on the way to Alaska, USA via Canada. This has led to a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases in the southern provinces and territories of Canada, especially in the densely populated Ontario and Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as a neighbor of Canada and the country with the largest number of cases in the world, the United States is continuing to grow at a daily rate of more than 30,000. Therefore, it is necessary for Canada to pay attention to the border issue because if cases imported from the United States are not well prevented, Canada will be affected for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;is-canadas-second-wave-coming&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is Canada’s second wave coming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first wave of COVID-19 has gradually subsided in Canada, and the number of daily cases and hospitalization rates have dropped to levels not seen since the beginning of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:positive-rate&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/post/covid19canada/index_files/figure-html/positive-rate-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;The positive rate began to decline after March, and began to rise again after August.&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 2: The positive rate began to decline after March, and began to rise again after August.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with more than 6,000 cases of COVID-19 active throughout the weekend, Canadians are urged to stay vigilant and take adequate public health measures until the long weekend. Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia have all recently found that the number of active COVID-19 cases has been steadily increasing, and there have not been some records since the peak of the outbreak. We can also observe from Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:positive-rate&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, that although the positive rate has dropped to about 0.01 after the first wave, the overall trend has been moving upward recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:daily-cases&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;htmlwidget-2&#34; style=&#34;width:720px;height:480px;&#34; class=&#34;widgetframe html-widget&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&#34;application/json&#34; data-for=&#34;htmlwidget-2&#34;&gt;{&#34;x&#34;:{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;/post/covid19canada/index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_daily-cases.html&#34;,&#34;options&#34;:{&#34;xdomain&#34;:&#34;*&#34;,&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;:false,&#34;lazyload&#34;:false}},&#34;evals&#34;:[],&#34;jsHooks&#34;:[]}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 3: After August, the number of daily new cases in Alberta and BC rebound again. By click the legend to hide or show the line of that province.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the number of daily new cases are also increasing in multiple provinces and has raised concerns about a potential second wave. In Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:daily-cases&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, it presents the changing of daily new cases in different province or territories. Infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch says this surge in infections might ‘very well’ be the start of that next phase in the pandemic, and that current upward trends in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec may be fuelling Canada’s second wave of coronavirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&#34;6&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“COVID-19 does not take holidays.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China moved quickly to quell a new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing on June, raising its emergency level, suspending reopening and cancelling more than 60 per cent of flights in and out of the capital after reporting at least 256 new cases since early June. If Canada takes a similar approach to control new outbreaks, it foreseeable that they can avoid more drastic measures like shutting down non-essential businesses and reimposing lockdown measures across the country for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
